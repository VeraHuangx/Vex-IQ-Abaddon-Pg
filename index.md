**Welcome to the official webpage for the 2023-24 VEX IQ team Abaddon!**

We designed this webpage as a way to further connect with our competition, judges and even our own team members! We will update this webpage with info on the competitions we are attending, group updates and maybe even top-secret bot pictures... This will be a good way to keep the HBS Abaddon legacy for years to come, and share our experiences with future VEX IQ teams. 


# Meet the team!

**Vera** is the team leader, and often likes to think she knows what she's doing. She plays the guzheng, does ballet, could eat pho 24/7 and wants to be a game dev when she grows up.

**Gabby** is one of the programmers. She plays the piano, violin, organ, drums and guitar and lives to drink bubble tea and read books.

**Anjali** is one of the builders. She plays cricket, badminton, netball, the piano and the clarinet. She loves to go shopping with her friends.

**Erika** is one of the programmers. She likes dancing and singing and has a travel blog of YouTube. She listens to music 24/7. 

**Isabel** is the designer. She loves to play the piano. She is obsessed with car and loves anything to do with mechanics.



## Why are we - definitely - the best VEX IQ team there is?

> It's a pretty bold claim right? Reading this and getting to know us for the first time, this must come off as a very skeptical, false piece of information, but, although it seems unlikely, we can assure you, it's true.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.
