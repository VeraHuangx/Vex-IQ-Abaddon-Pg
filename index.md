**Welcome to the official webpage for the 2023-24 VEX IQ team Abaddon!**

We designed this webpage as a way to further connect with our competition, judges and even our own team members! We will update this webpage with info on the competitions we are attending, group updates and maybe even top-secret bot pictures... This will be a good way to keep the HBS Abaddon legacy for years to come, and share our experiences with future VEX IQ teams. 


# Meet the team!

**Erika** is one of the programmers. She likes dancing and singing and has a travel blog of YouTube. She listens to music 24/7. 

**Isabel** is the designer. She loves to play the piano. She is obsessed with car and loves anything to do with mechanics.



## Why are we a successful VEX IQ team?

> It's a pretty bold claim right? Reading this and getting to know us for the first time, this must come off as a very skeptical, false piece of information, but, although it seems unlikely, we can assure you, it's true.
>
> When the VEX team was gathered in year 7, out of more than 80 kids, only 12 were chosen through a pretty brutal round of elimination  based on the skills of the role you signed up for. Following this was also a pretty nerve-racking interview which I'm sure everyone was terrified of. The few people that were picked from the eager girls in our school were *made* for the job they got.
>
> When we started the season, we were a little bit behind. Getting to know each other, fiddling with CAD, it was never easy. The girls in HBS were and still are always busy, dealing with clubs, networking, and trying to discreetly cut in the line during lunchtime. One person had a totally different agenda to the next person, and many sacrifices were made to sustain the performance of the team. As well as this, we faced many obstacles on the way.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
