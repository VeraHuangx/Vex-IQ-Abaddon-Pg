**Welcome to the official webpage for the 2023-24 VEX IQ team Abaddon!**

We designed this webpage as a way to further connect with our competition, judges and even our own team members! We will update this webpage with info on the competitions we are attending, group updates and maybe even top-secret bot pictures... This will be a good way to keep the HBS Abaddon legacy for years to come, and share our experiences with future VEX IQ teams. 


# Meet the team!

*Vera* is the team leader, and often likes to think she knows what she's doing. She plays the guzheng, does ballet, could eat pho 24/7 and wants to be a game dev when she grows up.

*Gabby* is one of the programmers. She plays the piano, violin, organ, drums and guitar and lives to drink bubble tea and read books.
